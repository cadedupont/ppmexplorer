    <p class="mb-4">
      PPMExplorer is a project aimed to drawing new insights from images and captions in the Pompei:
      Pitture e Mosaic (PPM) encyclopedia set. The project uses Svelte for building the web
      application, Microsoft Azure AI Vision API for generating image and caption feature vectors,
      and Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB for storing and indexing the data.

      Dr. Cindy Roulette, a former Ph.D. student at the University of Arkansas, developed a similar
      application using Unity in 2020. Our objective for this project is to recreate the application
      in a web-based format and modernize its features to incorporate advancements in computer
      vision, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.
